# kh2fm-hints-demo

Bare bones hint generator for the Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix randomizer.
Based on SpikeVegeta's hint system where each Ansem Report is a hint that tells you how many important checks are in a world.

Important Checks:
* 3 Proofs
* Promise Charm
* 5 drive forms
* 4 summons
* Magic (18 total)
* 5 Torn Pages
* 13 Ansem Reports

Other notes:
* Disney Castle and Timeless River are combined into "Disney Castle"
* Cavern of Remembrance is considered part of "Hollow Bastion"
* Sora's Heart refers to level ups (level up checks only go up to 50 right now)
* Absent Silhouettes and Data Org members are included in their respective worlds
